# Learning-Python
These are the files created from learning the "Learning Python" course on Linkedin.

The course goes through from basic loops and the use of functions and classes to using often-used 
libraries such as the datetime library and web parsing libraries.

It was a good refresher on the use of the date library, and an interesting look at web parsing and calling,
with my recent work on building a crypto trading bot.
